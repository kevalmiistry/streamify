- Used **React with Vite** (No meta-framework) as per the project guidelines.
- Used **TypeScript** for:
  - Better type safety & IntelliSense.
  - Reduced runtime errors.
  - Improved code maintainability.
- Used **Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI** for:
  - Rapid development with utility-first styling.
  - Consistent & accessible UI components.
  - Easy customization and theming.
- Used **Zustand** for handling complex global state because:
  - It minimizes unnecessary re-renders.
  - It improves performance and scalability.
  - Based on my experience, an efficient global state-management approach is crucial in React apps.
